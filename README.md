## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
- **Data Handling:** File I/O (text files for temporary storage)
- **Platform:** Console-based application (Windows/Linux terminal)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- ❌ No persistent database (data is lost on restart)
- ❌ No GUI (command-line only)
- ❌ Passwords stored in plain text (no encryption)
- ❌ Single-user system (no real-time synchronization or multi-user support)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- ✅ Integrate a relational database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL)
- ✅ Build a user-friendly GUI using Qt or Python (Tkinter/PyQt)
- ✅ Encrypt user credentials and sensitive data
- ✅ API integrations for real-time tracking and payment gateways
