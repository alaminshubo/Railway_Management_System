# 🛠️  Technology Stack

Language: C++ (OOP principles)

Data Handling: File I/O (temporary storage)

Limitations: No database/GUI (console-only).

# ⚠️ Limitations

❌ No persistent storage (data lost on restart).

❌ Console-based UI (no GUI).

❌ Basic security (passwords stored in plain text).

❌ No real-time sync (single-user only).

# 🔮 Future Improvements

✅ Integrate a database (SQLite/MySQL).

✅ Develop a GUI (Qt/Python).

✅ Add encryption for user data.

✅ Connect to APIs (payment/tracking).
